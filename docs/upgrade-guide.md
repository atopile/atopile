# Upgrade Guide

Firstly, thanks for using atopile! It's been a ride, and we're glad you're here.

## Upgrading from v0.2.x to v0.3.x

### `DeprecationWarning`

There will be a LOT of new deprecation warnings you'll see.

For the most part, it's safe to ignore them for the minute, and we plan to make the breaking changes in 0.4.0

Upgrading will give you more access to features as they're added, but there's no need to rush if you're content.


## Component Creation

Old command: `ato install --jlcpcb C2040`
New command: `ato create component` or `ato create component --help`
