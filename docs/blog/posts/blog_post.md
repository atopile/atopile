# Our Journey: From Weekend Projects to Redefining Hardware Design
## Early Days: Can we build a predator drone?
Matt and I met at a scout camp when we were 13 and quickly became mates. We ended up chatting for the whole 12 hour bus ride home, scheming about the predator drone we were going to build, looking back at it, we were a bit ambitious.

The weekends Matt and I spent together stand out. They weren't filled with typical childhood pastimes; instead, we immersed ourselves in building and creating. Our projects were modest – from simple drones to CNC machines. I'll never forget our attempt at a liquid-fueled rocket motor. It was just a static fire, but to us, it was groundbreaking (our most recent attempt): '[Rocket Motor Static Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB_fUcHpbbk)'.

## Stepping into the Professional World
We got our start at Tesla and Lilium, eager to see if our weekend tinkering would translate to the real world. At these companies, we learned a lot about manufacturing and bringing products to market. While inspired by the technology and talent around us, we noticed the innovation process was slower and more traditional than we expected.

## Facing Industry Realities
After a little jumping around, we both ended up at Tesla together, which is when we met Tim. We quickly found common ground in our experiences. Even though we were part of some exciting projects, the reality of day-to-day work often meant dealing with a lot of repetition and slow-moving processes. The job started to feel less about innovation and more about navigating through routine procedures. It wasn't the dynamic environment we had dreamed of, it was becoming just a job.

## A Shift in Perspective: The Seed of an Idea
In our quest to recapture the passion and pace of our earlier projects, we started to brainstorm solutions outside of work. There were plenty of setbacks and learning curves. But these challenges led us to a pivotal realization: What if we could streamline hardware design using language-based descriptions? In my day job, our team was managing 10+ designs each disconnected from the other, meaning it could take us years to roll out improvements across all of them. The idea of simply making a PR for each to update that particular module sounded too good to be true.

## Our Vision: A Humble Hope for Change
We’re not claiming to have all the answers or to revolutionize the industry overnight. But we do have a vision: a future where the process of designing hardware is more efficient, where teams, no matter their size, can work on complex products without getting bogged down by outdated methods. We believe this will make the process significantly faster and less costly, bringing us closer to the agility and joy of those weekend projects from our youth.

## An Invitation to Join Our Journey
This journey is just beginning, and there’s a long road ahead. We’re sharing our story not just to talk about our idea, but to invite collaboration, feedback, and shared learning. Together, we can explore ways to bring a new level of dynamism and creativity to hardware design. We’re excited about the future and we hope you’ll join us in this endeavor.
