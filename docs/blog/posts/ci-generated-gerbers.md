# Trivial mistakes are expensive ðŸ¤‘

Continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) is does things in software like running tests and deploying code automatically.

We've unfortunately been a little too responsible for some pretty expensive trivial mistakes in the past, so it's a key thing we wanted to focus on in `atopile`.

Instead of all shaking hands and totally agreeing that this local export named "pcb-final-final-final" is what we're going to spend serious money on - we can generate the manufacturing files on a trusted server

... and stamp them with the precise version of the source-code used to create them!

No more export mistakes ðŸ‘Œ. Plus, it makes ordering boards super easy!
