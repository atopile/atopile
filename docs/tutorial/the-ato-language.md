# 1. Basics of the `ato` language

`ato` is a domain specific language (DSL) for describing electronic circuit boards.

It's heavily inspired by, and attempts to largely follow the syntax of Python üêç for consistency and familiarity.

## Basic types

The most basic types in `ato` are a `module` and an `interface`.

A `signal` is a special built-in type of `interface` that represents a single [electrical](https://github.com/atopile/atopile/blob/main/src/faebryk/library/Electrical.py#L7) interface.

A `component` is a subclass of a `module` that expects to represent a single physical component.

You can also define you own types, in a similar way to define a `class` in Python.
Like classes in most modern languages, we can subclass and inherit from blocks.

```ato
module SomeModule:
    signal some_signal
    signal gnd
    some_variable = "some value"

module SubclassedModule from SomeModule:
    # inherits all the signals and variables from SomeModule
    # we don't need to declare the signals again,
    # but we will replace the value of some_variable
    some_variable = "some other value"

module Test:
    signal gnd
    # creates an instance of the SubclassedModule
    subclased_module = new SubclassedModule
    # connects the some_signal of the SubclassedModule to the gnd of Test
    subclased_module.gnd ~ gnd
```

!!! info
    You can subclass a `module` as a `component`, but not the other way around. A component is expected to represent a specific component.

## Configuring blocks

Configuration of a `module` or `interface` is done by assigning to it's attributes.

```ato
some_instance.value = 100ohm +/- 10%
```

Unlike Python, you don't need to state `self.` and instead any assignments you make within the scope of a block, are automatically assigned to the block.

There are a number of built-in attributes that influence the behaviour of the compiler with respect to the block.

Setting the `package` attribute, for example, will make the compiler select only components with the specified package to be used in that component's slot.

## Connecting it up

Any `interface` can be connected to any other interface of the same type using the `~` operator.

```ato
some_signal ~ another
```

## Units and tolerances, assertions and maths

Remember how NASA slung a rocket straight into Mars because of a metric/imperial boo boo?

How about we don't do that again.

### Units

Resistors's resistances must be a resistance; whether `1.23Œ©` (option+Z on OSx), `1.23ohm`, `4.56Kohm`, `7.89Mohm` or similar.

Any attribute of any block may have a unit attached written (without a space) after any number.

Unsurprisingly, caps capacitances need to be a capacitance; eg. `23.4uF`, various limits in volts, amperes, degrees and so on.

Add units.

### Tolerances

Another unfamiliar first-class language feature when dealing with the physical world is the ability (and generally requirement)
to spec tolerances for attributes.

You could try find a `10kŒ©` resistor, but my money says you won't - it'll likely be at least `10kŒ© +/- 0.1%` (which you can
write!)

Tolerances can be written in the forms of:
- `1V to 2V`
- `3uF +/- 1uF`
- `4Kohm +/- 1%`

These are hopefully sufficiently intuitive as to not warrant further explanation ü§û


### Units and Tolerances

With Units and Tolerances together, we can define physical attributes.

There's quite a few legal ways to combine them!

- `3V to 3.6V` perhaps for a supply rail
- `3V +/- 10mV` maybe for a reference
- `4.7uF +/- 20%` for a generic cap
- even `25lb +/- 200g` ü§£


### Sweet, so now I've got all these values around the place... what can I do with them?

:sparkles: **Maths** :sparkles:

There are two things that atopile can do for you with these values:
1. Check that assertions about their relationships to one another are true
2. Solve systems of constraints based on these relationships for find component values

This maths is all done including the units and tolerances, so you can be sure absolutely sure everything always works.

Use the `assert` keyword to apply constraints on the values of attributes to one another.

Supported operators are currently `<`, `>` and `within` (all are inclusive of the bounds).

```atopile
a = 1 ¬± 0.1
b = 2 ¬± 0.2
c: resistance  # variable declaration without assignment

assert a < b  # always true before 0.9 and 1.1 (the bounds of a) are both lower than the bounds of b (1.8 and 2.2)
assert a > b  # always false --> Will yield a failure at compile time
assert c within 1Kohm to 10Kohm  # first solved for, then the solution is independently checked at the end of the build
```

I'm not sure about you, but I (Matt) am pretty dumb and don't love working too hard.
Perhaps you've got a better method, but generally when I'm trying to find resistor values for something even as simple as a voltage divider, I guess one that seems approximately right, then calculate the other - giving me something that doesn't exist, before finally checking through a few other options close-by until finding a pair that works.

This is fine and dandy as long as you only care about the ratio of a voltage divider, but as soon as you need to check what that does for your regulators output voltage? Ergh, fine! What about the extremes of the tolerances on those resistors? Fine I'll do it once - but I swear if someone goes to tweak those values for whatever reason, I am unlikely to be pleased.

So, let's get atopile to do it for us!

atopile will automatically solve systems of constraints for you with free variables, and check that the values of attributes are within their tolerances.

## Specialization

The `->` operator will specialize a module from it's existing instance, to an instance of the type on the right hand side.

```ato
some_instance -> AnotherModuleType
```

This is useful for configuring a previously specified topology.
