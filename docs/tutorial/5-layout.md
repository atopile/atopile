# 5. Layout

`ato` code defines the function of the circuit via how everything is connected up. Unlike a software compiler, these components all need to end up placed somewhere and copper traces need to be routed between the elements for the circuit to function.

This process is typically called "layout".

atopile uses [KiCAD](kicad.org), the premier open-source electronics design package for layout.
