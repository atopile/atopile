#
# OVERVIEW OF SCHEMATIC AUTOROUTER
#
# The input is a Node containing child nodes and parts, each with a
# bounding box and an assigned (x,y) position. The following operations
# are done for each child node, and then for the parts within this node.
#
# The edges of each part bbox are extended to form tracks that divide the
# routing area into a set of four-sided, non-overlapping switchboxes. Each
# side of a switchbox is a Face, and each Face is a member of two adjoining
# switchboxes (except those Faces on the boundary of the total
# routing area.) Each face is adjacent to the six other faces of
# the two switchboxes it is part of.
#
# Each face has a capacity that indicates the number of wires that can
# cross through it. The capacity is the length of the face divided by the
# routing grid. (Faces on a part boundary have zero capacity to prevent
# routing from entering a part.)
#
# Each face on a part bbox is assigned terminals associated with the I/O
# pins of that symbol.
#
# After creating the faces and terminals, the global routing phase creates
# wires that connect the part pins on the nets. Each wire passes from
# a face of a switchbox to one of the other three faces, either directly
# across the switchbox to the opposite face or changing direction to
# either of the right-angle faces. The global router is basically a maze
# router that uses the switchboxes as high-level grid squares.
#
# After global routing, each net has a sequence of switchbox faces
# through which it will transit. The exact coordinate that each net
# enters a face is then assigned to create a Terminal.
#
# At this point there are a set of switchboxes which have fixed terminals located
# along their four faces. A greedy switchbox router
# (https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-9260(85)90029-X)
# does the detailed routing within each switchbox.
#
# The detailed wiring within all the switchboxes is combined and output
# as the total wiring for the parts in the Node.
