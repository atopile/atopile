- docs/pr-scope-followups.md: remove
- dont understand the agent mediatior, can you explain its purpose (can add it to this document)
- dont think we want agent/skills.py - we are just handling skills with the two skills file, agent and ato that are injected in the context

## mediator purpose
- The mediator is a lightweight "tool advisor" layer for the chat UI.
- It does not execute tools. `agent/tools.py` executes tools, and `orchestrator.py` decides + runs tool calls.
- It provides:
  - tool directory metadata for UI discoverability
  - ranked tool suggestions from user text + recent history
  - prefilled args/prompt hints for faster tool selection
  - stale-result hints using per-tool memory summaries
- Why this exists:
  - keeps `orchestrator.py` focused on execution/retries/safety loops
  - keeps suggestion heuristics out of UI components
  - gives one place to tune "which tool should I try next?" behavior

## skills.py note
- `agent/skills.py` is currently not dead code. It is used by:
  - `agent/orchestrator.py` for fixed skill injection
  - `agent/orchestrator_helpers.py` for skill-cap allocation typing
  - `routes/agent/main.py` for `/api/agent/sessions/{session_id}/skills`
- If we want to simplify to only two fixed skills (`agent`, `ato`), we can still do that without deleting the module:
  - narrow loading to fixed ids only
  - optionally drop the session skills endpoint if no UI needs it
  - then inline small helpers and remove `skills.py` in a follow-up

## pr description: agent context summary
- The orchestrator now injects exactly two fixed skill docs into model instructions:
  - `.claude/skills/agent/SKILL.md`
  - `.claude/skills/ato/SKILL.md`
- Dynamic skill discovery/loading was removed (`agent/skills.py` deleted).
- Prompt context composition now has three primary sources:
  - fixed skill docs (`agent` + `ato`)
  - project context summary (module/build/project state)
  - registered tool definitions (`agent/tool_definitions*.py`) and tool-call outputs
- This reduces ambiguity: no runtime skill selection, no broad skills index, and no extra skill docs outside the two required files.
- Session skill metadata is still reported from orchestrator state, but no longer depends on scanning a skills directory at request time.
